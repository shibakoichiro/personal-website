I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the [Department of Epidemiology](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/epidemiology/) and [Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/social-and-behavioral-sciences/) at [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/). I am also affiliated with the [Human Flourishing Program at Harvard's Institute for Quantitative Social Science](https://hfh.fas.harvard.edu/).

My research focuses on the application of epidemiologic and social science thinking and methods for rigorous causal inference in studying social determinants of health. 

Specifically, I have worked on three themes of research. First, I study the effects of traumatic events (e.g., disasters, child adversity, pandemic, and global financial crisis) on population health, with a particular focus on older adult populations. Second, I study the roles of social relationships and social engagement in promoting health of older adults and building resiliency. I have also investigated how the internet-based social interactions can influence population health. Third, my research extends the traditional "risk factor" epidemiology examining a narrow set of health outcomes. I study the impacts of positive psychological factors (e.g., purpose in life, Ikigai) on health and determinants of multidimensional well-being (i.e., human flourishing).

Methodologic tools for causal inference I often use include: methods for the analysis of time-varying treatment (e.g., marginal structural model, doubly-robust targeted maximum likelihood estimation), causal mediation analysis, assessment of effect heterogeneity using either traditional approach or a novel ML-based technique, and outcome-wide framework.
