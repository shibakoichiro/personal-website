I am a Research Fellow in the [Department of Epidemiology](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/epidemiology/) and [Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/social-and-behavioral-sciences/) at [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/). I am also affiliated with the [Human Flourishing Program at Harvard's Institute for Quantitative Social Science](https://hfh.fas.harvard.edu/).

My research focuses on application of epidemiologic and social science methods for rigorous causal inference to studies of social determinants of health. 

My dissertation research took advantage of a unique cohort study of Japanese older adults stemming from the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake to: 

- Conduct the natural experiment study to estimate the causal effects of neighborhood food- and built-environment on cardiometabolic profiles. 
- Investigate the long-term health consequences of a natural disaster among survivors and mediating roles of post-disaster relocation.
- Review two underrecognized challeges in causal inference for studies of long-term health impacts of a disaster (or any adverse/traumatic event) and discuss analtyic approaches to deal with the problems.

As a postdoctoral research fellow, I work with [Ichiro Kawachi](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/ichiro-kawachi/) [(lab website for Japanese scholars)](http://societyandhealthlab.com/) to integrate causal inference and machine learning to examine heterogeneous effects of a natural disaster on health of survivors. Through this project, we aim to assess the impacts of a disaster on health disparities and identify community- and individual-level resilience factors that make people less susceptible to disasters. I also work with [Tyler VanderWeele](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/tyler-vanderweele/) on applications of causal inference thinking and methos to investigate determinants of human flourishing.
